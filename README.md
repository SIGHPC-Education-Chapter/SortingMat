Sorting Mat Activity, from CSUnplugged.org

**One-Liner Description:**
A Parallel Sorting Activity using a Sorting Network

**Extended Description:**

Sorting people, by name, or height, or any other sortable characteristic, using a parallel sorting network.
It's fun and engaging to get the kids to draw the network on some pavement with chalk, or you can use a sheet if you don't have any handy, safe pavement or concrete.
Take 6 kids, get themselves to sort themselves through the network - each time they take a step forward they should wind up in a new circle, or node, and then compare themselves with the other person in the node.  Check that they wind up sorted at the end.

It helps to have a chant to recite so that they remember how to sort themselves, such as "shorter goes left, taller goes right" and get the whole class to recite that at each step of the algorithm.
Check if they can go backwards and still wind up sorted.
Check different arrangements of people at the start, including shuffled, reverse sorted, and in order.
Check what happens if you are only sorting 5 people, or 4. 
Extensions:
  Get the kids to design a network that will sort 8 people!
  Work out the relationship between number of objects to be sorted (n) and number of nodes. Test it on more than 2 values of n.

**Concepts**
Sorting, and parallel processing

**Complexity**
With a sorting mat (I use a sheet with the network drawn on it), it can be done in 20 minutes to half an hour, but can take much longer if you investigate all variations. 

**Learning Outcomes**
Understand the efficiency gains of parallel processing

**Group Size**
minimum of 6, up to a whole class
